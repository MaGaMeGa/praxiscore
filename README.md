# PraxisCORE v5

This is the repository for PraxisCORE v5 development.

PraxisCORE v5 is a major restructure, moving to Java 11, replacing the NetBeans module system with Java modules, and moving to a Maven build system.

PraxisCORE is an open-source project originally developed by [Neil C Smith][neilcsmith], and supported by [Codelerity Ltd][codelerity].

## Information

PraxisCORE is a modular JVM runtime for cyberphysical programming, supporting real-time coding of real-time systems. It is the heart of [PraxisLIVE][praxislive]. With a distributed forest-of-actors architecture, runtime code changes and comprehensive introspection, PraxisCORE brings aspects of Erlang, Smalltalk and Extempore into the Java world ... a powerful platform for media processing, data visualisation, sensors, robotics, IoT, and lots more!
